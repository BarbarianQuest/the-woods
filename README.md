A 2D component based in-house game engine written by the Cunning Folk.

Development Blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://cunningfolkgames.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>

The engine is designed to build 2D top-down adventure games, but could in theory be made more general in the future. There is no front end to the engine (for now) but it has been written with this future goal in mind.

The engine is written in C++ and C, scripting is achieved through Lua bindings, and data is stored as JSON. For examples of how these files look, the old-growth repository is the growing library of entities and scripts that were built for demonstrations. This repository is open source for now.

If for a moment you lose all sense of clarity and want to write a game in the engine, feedback is always appreciated and we'd love to see what you make. Much of the engine was built from a solid bedrock of inexperience, and a lot of it is ripe for refactoring. If you do find a bug or something that could be improved, we'd love to hear about that too!

Huge thanks to these projects which made our lives much easier:

SFML Project,
rapidjson,
Sol2,
Lua,
OpenGL

And huge thanks to all the great people who are still excited whenever we show off the game, despite how slowly we're moving with it, you're all wonderful <3
